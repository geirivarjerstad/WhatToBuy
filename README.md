# WhatToBuy - An Ionic Framework hybrid app 

Developed with TDD approach and relying heavily on unittesting to make sure the system is working as intended. This is done by using Jasmine2 and the Karma testrunner.

## Techstack
Unittesting involved testing:
- Promises
- AngularJS related including Route, Controller, Service

Integrationtesting was done using "ng-midway-tester"

## Server
Servercode is not included in this repository, and connection to the server is removed in this repo. Usually the serverurl is stored in globals.js.
Server is running in Azure and implemented with ServiceStack and EntityFramework.
